shipped:
  - **sonic-mast clean close** at 16:32Z — "Solid framing. Waiting on attribution. Flag here when the referrer-tagged endpoint ships." Marks the cleanest exchange in the lost-reopen-conditional pattern: trigger fired honestly + customer validated honestly + no reply needed from my side. Loop fully closed pending attribution-endpoint ship.
  - **Known-org PR scan** — alexgo/leather/Zest/Hiro/Stacks/secretkeylabs/Bitflow last 5d. Useful negative: zero new prospects, surface already well-covered by existing pipeline. mooncitydev shipped a fresh Bitflow repo but Bitflow already pitched (p026); ed-snacks shipped on Leather (p031); Amber Otter IC shipped on bff-skills (good IC signal). Banked to scouts.
  - **Arc IC #4 accepted email mandate + manual CF Email Worker caveat** prev cycle.
  - **sonic-mast reopen-trigger fired** earlier today.
  - **6 emails in 28h + email-status.sh + BCC** earlier.
  - **Diagnosed operator "no visibility"** — Resend HTTPS API sends don't appear in any Gmail "Sent" folder because Gmail isn't the SMTP path. Resend confirmed delivery for all 6 prospect emails today + the 3 Apr 28 tests; emails are landing but Gmail is sorting brand-new sender to Spam/Promotions. DMARC missing on drx4.xyz is the upstream cause.
  - **DMARC ask filed to operator** — `_dmarc.drx4.xyz TXT v=DMARC1; p=none;` (rua optional). CF API token here is zone:read only, no DNS:edit; operator handles DNS edit in CF dashboard. Will recheck and re-test deliverability once added.
  - **Apr 30 fire script HARDENED** prev cycle — 4 silent-failure bugs caught + fixed pre-deploy.
  - **Continuous research scan** earlier — 3 Tier-1 candidates banked for May 1+.
  - **p085-p087 pipeline backfill** earlier — pipeline 94→97.
  - **Apr 30 PT pre-flight COMPLETE** earlier — drafts + lint + canonical sync.
  - **EIC ack on #664 Day 1** earlier — pitch language locked until May 5.
  - **6 emails in 28h** all nurture, Day 2 warmup holding (Resend confirms delivery).
observations:
  - **Operator PR #670** (merged 06:32Z today) shipped the fix for "JingSwap appearing post-expiry in rotation" that I flagged in my Day 1 #664 milestone post. Quick-turn fix loop working. Listing rotation now correctly excludes same-day expired ads.
  - **DMARC still missing on drx4.xyz** — operator pending DNS edit. Email send hold continues.
  - **EIC + Distribution-DRI dual co-sign on "measurement in progress" pitch language** until May 5 rollup.
  - **Active classifieds = 1 (mine).** Deep Tess close-pending-publish ~3d, no POST yet.
