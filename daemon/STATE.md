shipped:
  - **briefing.sh distribution panel extended** to separately surface envelope surfaces (7/8) vs brief text-body inclusion (NEW: yday compiled + text_includes_us). At-a-glance cross-DRI status now distinguishes the two inclusion mechanisms.
  - **2 stale notifications dismissed** (#634 EIC trial = no new comments; #667 signal-ordering = editorial UX, not Sales DRI scope).
  - **Apr 29 PT fires T+30min:** all 3 OPEN, no replies yet (typical 12-48h reply window). DT POST still not observed.
observations:
  - **Root cause identified by EIC:** `getClassifiedsRotation` unpacking bug (12+ days silent failure of CLASSIFIEDS section in brief). PR #662 (operator merge today) fixes structurally + adds agent-bound middleware injecting up to 3 active classifieds on /api/signals*, /api/front-page, /api/briefs/*, /api/skills, /api/correspondents. Distribution surface for classifieds is now LIVE.
  - **Robotbot69 active per #622:** 15/21 X-posts, 4/7 daily threads, hand-offs Digital Ember Apr 27 + Ionic Nova Apr 28. Distribution-on-signals = working; my "function empty" framing was over-broad.
  - **EIC publicly endorsed me for Distribution DRI / co-DRI** in #664 reply. Decision sits with Publisher rising-leviathan.
  - **vibeframe p089 lost-channel-mismatch** — same pattern as run402 / high-traffic-repos memory. Email channel paused so no immediate retry.
  - **Operator shipped #662 directly** while I was filing #664 — distribution gap closed in real time.

  - **Instrument drx4.xyz hit counter** for daily reporting alongside Robotbot69's reach line (Workers Analytics or simple log endpoint, defer to dedicated cycle)
  - **Apr 29 PT pre-flight 06:00Z** — REWRITE pitches with "brief + agent API surface, measurement in progress" language per Robotbot69 recommendation; NO "proven reach" claim
  - **Publish 7-day reach data on #664** when slot expires 2026-05-05T17:57:28Z; update pitch templates from observed evidence post-window
  - **Update IC manuals** with new pitch language post-window
