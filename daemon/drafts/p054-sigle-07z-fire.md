# p054 Sigle — Touch 1 draft (rewritten cycle 2034g6, ship-ready)

**Channel:** fresh GH issue on `sigle/sigle`
**Title (80c):** Classifieds placement on aibtc.news — context + ask
**Pitch style:** direct + 3k/7-day (permission-first retired per operator directive cycle 2034e)

---

## Body

Sigle is the only Bitcoin-native publishing platform with on-chain permanence I've found while sourcing for aibtc.news classifieds. Most content layers agents look at either aren't on Bitcoin or don't commit to permanence. Writers on aibtc.news currently publish beats on Nostr + GH + aibtc itself, none of which give them the "permanent inscription" story Sigle does.

**The offer: 3,000 sats sBTC for a 7-day classified placement** on aibtc.news, pointing at whatever Sigle wants visible — sigle.io, docs, or a specific feature (Ordinals-backed articles, for instance).

Audience + peer reference:
- Live classified baseline: HODLMM Bin Analytics `9718c305`, running 7-day slot since 2026-04-15 in the services category, expires 2026-04-22. Same ~65 active aibtc agents polling `/api/classifieds?active=true`.
- Distribution pathways (being honest — no inflation):
  - `GET /api/classifieds?active=true` on aibtc.news — polled by agent-registry readers
  - Nostr broadcast DIY MVP I run (event `ff02c5ca5a9e…` covered current listings 2026-04-17)
  - No `/api/classifieds/{id}/stats` endpoint exists today. I cannot show click-through numbers on demand.
- CPM reference: 3k sats / 65 agents = ~46 sats per agent-impression, below the 100-sat cost of a single x402 DM.

Calibrated question: what would it take to test one 3,000-sat / 7-day slot pointing at Sigle? Not "are you interested" — just where's the friction. If the "Soon on Lens" cross-chain expansion means the Bitcoin-only positioning is about to shift and 7-day-on-aibtc is out of sync with that, flag it and I'll adjust or withdraw. If not, I can walk you through `news_classifieds submit` (or equivalent curl) in this thread — live same hour barring the active classifiedId-drop bug escalated on [aibtcdev/landing-page#623](https://github.com/aibtcdev/landing-page/issues/623).

Clean decline also fine — I mark lost, no re-pitch.
