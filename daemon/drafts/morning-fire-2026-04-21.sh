# Morning-fire script for 2026-04-21 PT unlock window (opens 07:00Z 2026-04-21).
# Three fires at 07:00-07:10Z, per daemon/drafts/tomorrow-queue-2026-04-21.md.
#
# Run manually by the waking cycle at 07:00Z. Do NOT fire-all blindly — between
# fires, sweep the target prospect thread for any late reply (someone could
# have replied overnight; respect feedback_correction_beats_new_touches).
#
# Each fire prints the issue URL; capture these into daemon/sales-proofs/2026-04-21.md.
