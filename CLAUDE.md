## Autonomous Loop Architecture

Claude IS the agent. `/start` enters the native `/loop` with `ScheduleWakeup`-based cycling:

1. `.claude/loop.md` — compact cycle prompt (loaded by native /loop mechanism)
2. `daemon/pillars/` — modular pillar instructions (bitcoin, news, bff, bd, bounties, onboarding, contribute)
3. After each cycle, `ScheduleWakeup(900)` schedules the next (15 min default)
4. `/stop` saves state, syncs git, and exits the loop

### Key Files
- `.claude/loop.md` — Native loop prompt (compact, ~130 lines)
- `daemon/pillars/*.md` — Pillar instructions loaded on-demand
- `daemon/loop.md` — Legacy full reference (693 lines, NOT loaded during cycles)
- `daemon/STATE.md` — Inter-cycle handoff (max 14 lines)
- `daemon/health.json` — Cycle stats, circuit breakers, pillar state
- `daemon/queue.json` — Task queue from inbox messages
- `daemon/processed/` — inbox.json + github.json (dedup tracking)

### AIBTC Endpoints
- **Heartbeat:** `POST https://aibtc.com/api/heartbeat` — params: `signature` (base64 BIP-137), `timestamp` (ISO 8601 with .000Z)
- **Inbox (FREE):** `GET https://aibtc.com/api/inbox/{stx_address}` — params: status (unread/all), limit, offset
- **Reply (FREE):** `POST https://aibtc.com/api/outbox/{my_stx_address}` — params: messageId, reply, signature
- **Send (PAID):** `POST https://aibtc.com/api/inbox/{recipient}` — x402 flow, 100 sats
- **Mark read:** `PATCH https://aibtc.com/api/inbox/{addr}/{msgId}`
- **Docs:** https://aibtc.com/llms-full.txt

## Memory (Tiered Writes)
- `daemon/STATE.md` — Inter-cycle handoff (max 14 lines, MANDATORY every cycle)
- `daemon/health.json` — Cycle stats (MANDATORY every cycle)
- `memory/journal/` — Per-cycle journals (ONLY when cycle produced real output)
- `memory/contacts/` — index.json + {slug}.json (ONLY when interacted with agent)
- `memory/learnings/` — active.md + resolved.md (ONLY when something new learned)
- **Do NOT dual-write** to auto-memory during the loop. Let Claude's built-in auto-memory handle `~/.claude/` automatically. Workspace `memory/` files are for operator visibility and git history.
- Commit and push memory changes to GitHub during Phase 7 sync

## Self-Learning Rules
- **Session memory rule**: Files read in this session are in context — do NOT re-read them unless (a) you edited and need the new state, or (b) auto-compact fired.
- **Boot reads**: STATE.md + health.json at cycle start. Everything else on-demand.
- **Track processed messages**: Write replied message IDs to `daemon/processed/` to avoid duplicates.
- **Learn from errors**: Append to `memory/learnings/active.md`. If permanent, update CLAUDE.md.
- **Never repeat mistakes**: Check learnings before retrying failed operations.

## Pre-commit hook (scripts/hooks/pre-commit — 3 sections)

**Section 1: Secret scan** — rejects any staged diff containing a likely mnemonic, BIP32 xprv, GitHub/AWS/Slack/Stripe/OpenAI token, or PEM private key. **CANNOT be bypassed** (that mistake happened once, 2026-04-17; never again).

**Section 2: Cruise-mode block** — rejects commits touching ONLY `daemon/STATE.md` + `daemon/health.json`. Every cycle MUST produce real output: listing, route, signal, PR, comment, skill, or learning. If inbox and notifications are empty, self-direct into the backlog. Empty inputs ≠ permission to idle. Commit messages with cruise phrases (`monitoring cycle`, `quiet period`, `evening quiet`, `extending cadence`, `no new activity`) also rejected by commit-msg hook. Bypass (crash recovery only): `ALLOW_STATE_ONLY=1 git commit ...`

**Section 3: Pitch-lint** (added cycle 2034ge) — runs `scripts/lint-pitches.py` on staged `daemon/drafts/**/*.md`. Hard violations (retired wallet `SP4DXVEC…`, wrong pricing `30-day` / `30k sats`) block the commit. Soft warnings (aspirational distribution claims, permission-first phrasing) advise only. Historical or intentional drafts opt out via `<!-- lint-pitches:skip reason="..." -->` marker at top of file. Bypass (last resort): `ALLOW_PITCH_LINT_FAIL=1 git commit ...`

Install on a fresh clone: `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`

## North Star — drift reminder (daemon/NORTH_STAR.md)
Every cycle boot MUST read `daemon/NORTH_STAR.md` alongside STATE.md + health.json. It declares:
- The goal (active presence on aibtc.com + aibtc.news).
- Daily output minimums (2 BD + 1 signal + 1 BFF + 1 distribution).
- Drift tells (inbox unchanged 2+ cycles, signal pending 2+ cycles, extending delay > 900s, etc. → act on backlog).
- **Backlog of concrete open deliverables** — always ≥3 items. At cycle start, pick one and declare it in `STATE.md` as `cycle_goal`. At cycle end, either ship it and remove from NORTH_STAR, or name the substitute that shipped.
- Run `scripts/briefing.sh` for a compact boot dashboard (goal + state + open PRs + notifications + drift check).

## Context Compaction Instructions

When auto-compact triggers, preserve:
- Current cycle number and phase in progress
- Any unsigned/unsent replies (messageId + reply text + signature)
- Wallet unlock status
- Any task currently executing (queue item being worked)
- Recent API responses that haven't been acted on yet

Drop safely: previous cycle logs, file contents already read and acted on, old tool call results.

## Operating Principles
- Always verify before transacting (check balances, confirm addresses)
- Log all transactions in the journal
- Never expose private keys or mnemonics
- Ask operator for confirmation on high-value transactions
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented
- Learn from every interaction — update memory files with new knowledge
