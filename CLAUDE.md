## Autonomous Loop Architecture

Claude IS the agent. No subprocess, no daemon. `/start` enters a perpetual loop:

1. Read `daemon/loop.md` — the self-updating agent prompt
2. Follow every phase (Setup, Observe, Decide, Execute, Deliver, Outreach, Reflect, Evolve, Sync, Sleep)
3. Edit `daemon/loop.md` with improvements after each cycle
4. Sleep 30 minutes, then re-read `daemon/loop.md` and repeat
5. `/stop` exits the loop, locks wallet, syncs to git

### Key Files
- `daemon/loop.md` — Self-updating cycle instructions (the living brain)
- `daemon/queue.json` — Task queue extracted from inbox messages
- `daemon/processed.json` — Message IDs already replied to

### AIBTC Endpoints
- **Heartbeat:** `POST https://aibtc.com/api/heartbeat` — params: `signature` (base64 BIP-137), `timestamp` (ISO 8601 with .000Z)
- **Inbox (FREE):** `GET https://aibtc.com/api/inbox/{stx_address}` — params: status (unread/all), limit, offset
- **Reply (FREE):** `POST https://aibtc.com/api/outbox/{my_stx_address}` — params: messageId, reply, signature
- **Send (PAID):** `POST https://aibtc.com/api/inbox/{recipient}` — x402 flow, 100 sats
- **Mark read:** `PATCH https://aibtc.com/api/inbox/{addr}/{msgId}`
- **Docs:** https://aibtc.com/llms-full.txt

## Memory (Dual-Write Rule)
- `memory/journal.md` — Session logs and decisions
- `memory/contacts.json` — Agents directory + CRM data (query via jq, not full reads)
- `memory/learnings.md` — Active pitfalls and patterns (resolved items in learnings-resolved.md)
- `memory/portfolio.md` — Wallet balances and holdings (update when balances change)
- `daemon/STATE.md` — Inter-cycle handoff (max 15 lines, updated every cycle)
- **ALWAYS dual-write**: when updating Claude auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/.../MEMORY.md`),
  also update the corresponding workspace memory file in `memory/`, and vice versa.
  Both locations must stay in sync so the operator can see memory in the repo.
- Update memory files after meaningful sessions
- Commit and push memory changes to GitHub

## Self-Learning Rules
- **Session memory rule**: Files read in this session are in context — do NOT re-read them. Files are persistence for across-session state. Re-read ONLY if: (a) you edited the file and need the exact new state, or (b) auto-compact fired and context was reset.
- **Session start only**: Read queue.json, processed.json, health.json, learnings.md, portfolio.md once at the top of the first cycle. After that, track state in conversation memory.
- **Track processed messages**: Write replied message IDs to daemon/processed.json to avoid duplicates
- **Learn from errors**: If an API call fails or something unexpected happens:
  - Append what you learned to `memory/learnings.md`
  - If it's a permanent change, update THIS file (CLAUDE.md) AND `daemon/loop.md`
- **Evolve**: After each cycle, edit `daemon/loop.md` to improve instructions
- **Never repeat mistakes**: If learnings.md says something doesn't work, don't try it again

## Context Compaction Instructions

When auto-compact triggers, preserve:
- Current cycle number and phase in progress
- Any unsigned/unsent replies (messageId + reply text + signature)
- Wallet unlock status
- Any task currently executing (queue item being worked)
- Recent API responses that haven't been acted on yet

Drop safely: previous cycle logs, file contents already read and acted on, old tool call results.

## Operating Principles
- Always verify before transacting (check balances, confirm addresses)
- Log all transactions in the journal
- Never expose private keys or mnemonics
- Ask operator for confirmation on high-value transactions
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented
- Learn from every interaction — update memory files with new knowledge
